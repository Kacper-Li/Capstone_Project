Capstone project to feature a card game "Crib" coded in python.
# HOW TO RUN
python3 game.py
# OVERVIEW
There will be a main function aswell as twenty others.
# PLAN
A main game controller function/class, one to control the individual players too.
The main game controller should keep track of:
- scores
- cards on the board
- - The box "crib"
- - The Cut Card
- - The pegging progress
- HOW to score (different rules for card combos)
- the decks current contents (which cards gone)

The player controllers should keep track of:
- Players hand
- (not sure but communicate how much score the hand has? maybe function for this? also needs to update properly when cards are played)

# MAIN PROBLEMS INITIALLY
How to track a players cards
How to allow players to view and select their cards, view can be automatic at start of turn.
How to populate and persist the cards placed down.
How to keep a box alive
Some way/function to calculate the score of a certain move/hand.
- includes pegging to check whether player just got 15/pair/pair royale/flush
- includes box/hand with box having cut card too
- includes edge cases like jacks (nob and heel)
How to display updating score without just overcrowding the output terminal
- Becomes a problem when its last round and pegging scores might cause win, but score only displays end of rounds for simplicity.
